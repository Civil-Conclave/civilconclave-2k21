                The Case Study focuses on enhancing the help they need to build
                the skills necessary to develop and to launch innovative

                Through this event, we aim to give Teams working collaboratively
                to understand the role of research and ideation in solving
                real-life scenarios. We focus on providing unique points of view
                and context for understanding global problems and developing
                solutions at scale while gaining real-world experience. <br />
                <br />
                However, we also recognise the significance of learning that
                occurs outside of the formal classroom setting â€” learning that
                occurs within their cohort via institutional networks and
                through co-curricular experiences on the broader level.

              <p>
                Our research work aims to provide a clear and valuable vision of
                today's innovation in our industry while exploring its future
                potential for a greater diversity of participants, ideas, and
                outcomes. <br />
                <br />
                Engaging students from across the IITs in research, the Civil
                Conclave aims at stimulating sustainability using an
                evidence-based, scientific approach drawing on diverse
                methodologies. Results contribute to fundamental knowledge of
                their subjects and aid decision-makers as they face an ever more
                complex innovation landscape. <br />
                <br />
                Each Contingent from each IIT will consist of members of UG, PG
                and Ph.D students who will be presenting their Research Work In
                front of the committee consisting of veterans from every
                discipline of Civil Engineering. The Best Research Paper Work
                Award will be given in each discipline.

                pathways and networks to equip the IIT community to move

                In Civil Conclave, we offer our participants fantastic
                opportunities to attend talks from world-renowned guest
                speakers. <br />
                <br />
                We believe that listening openly to leading figures from
                business leaders and industry experts develop their confidence
                and exposure to real-world scenarios. <br />
                <br />
                Each of our expert speakers delivers a lecture on their central
                topic before taking questions from our student audience. We
                carefully organise our guest lecture series to ensure that our
                students attend stimulating, informative, and enjoyable
                sessions.
